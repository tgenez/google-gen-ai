The release begin with a new sprint 11.22.X with the old one version 11.21.X for the 1 project1

1. At the begin of the sprint, I have some version 11.21.5
2. You launch pipeline *gitlab-ci-global* manually with variable DEPLOY_VERSION *minor* or *major* => it will create version 11.22.0 for all projects
3. So new development will create image tagged 11.22.0
4. You need to put the first development of the sprint in UAT (after 1 week), you launch the pipeline  *gitlab-ci-global*  manually with variable DEPLOY_VERSION *patch* and activate the correct variable by project with true to deploy this project
5. It will create a tag 11.22.0 on the project => it will launch the staging pipeline to create a release gitlab and change the helm yaml
6. And the version will be incremented to 11.22.1 for this projects
7. Repeat the point 4,5,6 until the final version for the production
8. When you want to release in production, you need to go on each project and find the last tag pipeline and launch the last step production => it will update the helm yaml for the production configuration

can you improve this with a more detailed explanation
